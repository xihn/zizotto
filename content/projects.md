In my lazy years I have worked on some random things mostly created out of fustration or to learn. I cant say I am particularly proud of any of these but here they are:

# *[HTML, CSS]* zizotto
Theme for this site. Used with the [Zola](https://getzola.org) static site generator. Still WIP but source is avaliable [here](https://github.com/xihn/zizotto). Based on a Hugo theme called 'risotto' which can be found [here](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto). Includes modular themes and various QOL improvements.

# zero-to-hpc
Documentation and guide based on my own experiences to help others understand, build, and use HPC.
