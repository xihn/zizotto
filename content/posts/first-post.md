# Why did I make this site?

The main reasons I can think of are:
- I kept seeing people with similar sites
- to fill the empty site in the header of my resume with something
- document stuff to look back on, track personal growth
- speak my truth (horrible decision)
- learn things about web (i didnt learn shit)

The theme for this site was made by some guy named Joe Roe named risotto, I then ripped it off and got rid of all the extra elements like the floating side panel. I also decided to move it from the hugo static site generator to zola. I went with zola not because its faster or cause I am in love with rust or anything but simply because fuck it why not. I also liked a few themes that were exclusive to zola and wanted to have the option to use them as a fallback.

In ripping off the theme I also removed the tags because I don't find them useful and probably wont have enough posts to have them matter. I also got rid of the rss shit since I am not balls deep into all of that and got rid of the webring stuff as well.

Unfortunately Im probably not going to have all of the nerdy shit that most simliar sort of sites have. Im sadly not an arch linux, rust, emacs, fediverse, whateverthefuck type of person (shoutout to them tho) and unforunantely just a normal cornball. So this is my normal cornball site.
