<Fancy image of render of building + surrounding site>
The goal is to supplement asbuilt with google earth / maps imagery and 3D data to create somewhat presentable renders. Unfortuntely google earth does not have accurate enough data for extending asbuilts so this is NOT a replacement for professional mapping services, LIDAR, etc. This is for renders to look fancy so clients go "oooooohh ahhhh" and you get paid more maybe.
