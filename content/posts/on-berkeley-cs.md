In my time at Berkeley I have had the pleasure and pain of meeting lots of CS majors which has given me somewhat of an insight into the dichotomy of Berkeley CS and some of the industry, pathways, and relationships people form.

First I have the following chart showing the different types of people i have encountered. These are not strict boundaries or bins and there is a lot of overlap between these.


| Type                 | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Skills                                                                           | Outcomes                                                                                    |

### The linux enjoyer
This group consists of people who daily drive linux, contrib to open source, really love low level stuff like kernel dev, use rust, emacs, etc. If you know you know. I find this group to be somewhat tight knit, and really awesome, nerdy, but usually chill. I think there is a (somewhat true) stereotype that a lot of linux enjoyers are neurodivergent, femboys, etc. I also think out of anyone a lot of people I have met in this sort of area are very politically aware and are usually very leftist. I think generally this is really awesome, there is a sort of communalisim and philosophy behind open source that makes it beautiful. A lot of people within this area end up in the backend area of the industry and are usually the least appreciated but most crucial developers. Think systems engineers, site reliability, network engineer, etc. Although a lot of those roles also have a lot of old dinosaur people. Generally people also are somewhat aware that corporations and capitalism is evil.
### The normal cs enjoyer
This is probably the largest group. While the linux enjoyer used to be the largest before the industry became lucrative, the normal cs enjoyer is really everyone that is in it for a stable career. While they may have a bit of a passion for coding or math or something like that, its really the money or they couldn't really settle on anything else to do. There is no shame in the money aspect, everyone has to eat and some have incredible weight from family to support. I think most people that are sort of the normal cs enjoyer usually end up doing front-end sort of development or more higher level things and working with lots of frameworks.

### The startup corporate enjoyer

### The academia enjoyer

### Finding yourself
