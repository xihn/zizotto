# Miles Yeh (iy)
<br/>

Hi! Im currently an undergraduate student at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs/) interested in computer graphics, game development, and high preformance computing. I'm also working as a student assistant at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://cs.lbl.gov/) where I help out with optimizing HPC infrastructure.

<!--

Hi! I am currenlty a member of the technical staff at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/) working on optimizing HPC infrastructure. I hold a B.A from [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs/) and a M.S from the [University of Chicago](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/).

Im also a large supporter of privacy protections, anonymity, digital rights, right to repair, open source, anti DRM, etc.

I try and keep my online presence to a minimum to keep my life from being webscraped for training some AI model. I don't have much on this site, but feel free to check out some of my [projects](/projects/) or [posts](/posts/).
