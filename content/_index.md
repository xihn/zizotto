# Miles Yeh (iy)
<br/>

Hi! Im currently an undergrad student at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs/) interested in computer graphics, computational design, and high preformance computing. I'm also working as a student assistant at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/) where I help out with optimizing HPC infrastructure. 


Im also a large supporter of privacy protections, anonymity, digital rights, right to repair, open source, anti DRM, etc. 

I try and keep my online presence to a minimum to keep my life from being webscraped for training some AI model. I don't have much on this site, but feel free to check out some of my [projects](/projects/), [posts](/posts/), and [dotfiles](https://github.com/xihn/dotfiles).
